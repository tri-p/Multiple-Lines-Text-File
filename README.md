A method in Python that writes multiple lines of text that will be stored in a text file.

### To run the program
1. Open the file.
2. Open the text file named "mylife.txt".
3. Run the Python code. It will ask you to enter a line.
4. After entering a line, it will ask you if you want to enter another line.
